About MongoSearchBundle
=======================



Installation:
-------------


How you actually download the bundle is entirely up to you.  The easiest way is to grab it from [packagist.org](http://packagist.org/).

[https://packagist.org/packages/ajmorenodelarosa/mongosearch](https://packagist.org/packages/ajmorenodelarosa/mongosearch)


Usage examples:
---------------

The most basic search would be:

``` php
$db = $this->get('doctrine_mongodb')->getManager();
$finder = $this->get('mongosearch.finder')->finder('UserManagementBundle:User',$db);
$finder->find("test");
```

We will create a finder object using finder method of our service which will allow us find into our collection using any string. 
You can also perform paginated searches, such as:

``` php
$limit = 10;
$offset = $current_page*$limit;
$db = $this->get('doctrine_mongodb')->getManager();
$finder = $this->get('mongosearch.finder')->finder('UserManagementBundle:User',$db);
$finder->find("test", $limit, $offset);
```

We will work to allow performe more advanced searches in future releases
